After attending the International Conference on Applied Energy, I had the pleasure of staying in a traditional Japanese inn in Niigata. The atmosphere of this place was truly enchanting.

I absolutely loved the classic and vintage vibe of the house, along with the delightful fragrance of the wooden interior that greeted me every time I walked in. The quiet, serene environment and the warmth of the wooden architecture made my stay an unforgettable experience.

If you’re ever in Niigata, I highly recommend staying here. It’s the perfect place to unwind after a long day and soak in the beauty of traditional Japanese living.

I hope you get a chance to experience it for yourself!
